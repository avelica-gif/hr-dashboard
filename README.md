I am aware that this is an incompleted homework assignment. 

The first part of this assignment was fairly easy. We were given four different .js files and we are suppose to run the test to see if they pass. I have include the Screencastify link for at least that: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hRVMuIhjnHPEftM1E2FkMApD_cKQEhe/view

I was able to get the basic inquierer questions to work. I also got a recording for that: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UzbefcfrCf-eXbfqKW97NJ1YCY6gvbUR/view

Besides that, I was struggling a lot in trying to get to switch the inquierir questions for the other roles besides employee.
